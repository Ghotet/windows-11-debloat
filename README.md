## ⚠️ System Safety Notes

This script is designed specifically for **laptop and portable PC users**.  
It will **not** disable or affect:
- Bluetooth functionality
- Wi-Fi and networking services
- Audio drivers or touchpad-related components

All aggressive options (like Sticky Notes removal) are **commented out by default**.  
Restore point is created at the start for rollback support.

If any issues occur or services are impacted unexpectedly, open an issue in the repo and it’ll be reviewed.

> *Precision, not destruction.*

## Notes

This script was co-developed using GPT-4 for logic optimization, flag modularity, and PowerShell syntax support. Human intelligence guided the vision—AI filled in the syntax.

Use with awareness. Some tweaks are aggressive by default.
